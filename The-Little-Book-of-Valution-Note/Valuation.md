### Cash flow model and formular to the present value.

#### 1. Simple cash flow

Simple cash flow represents the value of cash at any point in the future.

$C_p=\frac{C_f}{1+d}$

where:

$C_p$ : The value of present cash

$C_f$ : The value of cash in the future

$d$ :   The discount rate

#### 2. Annuity Cash flow

Annuity cash flow represents amount of cash represented occurs in a constant distribution over time.

$C_p= C_a×\frac{1-\frac{1}{(1+d)^t}}{d}$

where:

$C_q$ : The annuity cash flow

$t$ : Time period

#### 3. Growing Annuity Cash flow

Growing annuity cash flow represents an amount of cash flow that increases at a constant rate over time.

$C_p= C_f×(1-g)×\frac{1-\frac{(1+g)^n}{(1+d)^n}}{d-g}$

where:

$g$ : Growth rate

$n$ : Number of period time

#### 4. Growing perpetuity Cash flow

Growing annuity cash flow represents an amount of cash flow that increases at a constant rate over time.

$C_p= \frac{C_e}{d-g}$

where:

$C_e$ : Expected cash flow next year
